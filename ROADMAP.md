# Decentralized Honeypots for DDoS Detection

The **Decentralized Honeypots for DDoS Detection** project is an innovative cybersecurity solution designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using a decentralized network of simulated honeypot services. These honeypots mimic real-world systems (HTTP, DNS, SMTP) to attract malicious traffic, which is then logged, analyzed, and classified using AI-driven models.

## Current Status

We have completed Phases 1 and 2, establishing a solid foundation with:
1. Three functional honeypots (HTTP, DNS, SMTP)
2. Traffic analysis and logging
3. Blockchain integration
4. Rule-based attack detection

Currently working on Phase 3, focusing on:
1. Enhancing the AI prediction system
2. Implementing ML models
3. Improving attack classification accuracy

Next steps:
1. Complete the ML model integration
2. Develop the frontend dashboard
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Prepare for production deployment
