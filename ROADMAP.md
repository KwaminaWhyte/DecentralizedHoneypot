The **Decentralized Honeypots for DDoS Detection** project is an innovative cybersecurity solution designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using a decentralized network of simulated honeypot services. These honeypots mimic real-world systems (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to attract malicious traffic, which is then logged, analyzed, and classified using AI-driven models.

Key features include:

1. **Simulated Honeypots**: A variety of honeypot protocols (HTTP, DNS, etc.) that attract DDoS traffic.
2. **AI-Driven Analysis**: Machine learning models classify attack patterns in real-time, detecting known and unknown attack types.
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Attack logs are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering.
4. **Real-Time Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface that displays real-time traffic data, attack sources, and classifications.

This project provides businesses with an advanced, decentralized solution to proactively monitor, detect, and defend against DDoS attacks, enhancing their cybersecurity posture while leveraging blockchain for transparency and trust.

Here’s a **comprehensive, prioritized list of tasks**, focusing on the **backend** and **AI side** of your **Decentralized Honeypots** project, specifically designed for **DDoS detection**. This will guide you through building and deploying the backend system with AI-powered analytics.

#### 2. **Traffic Detection & Logging**

- Implement rate-limiting detection:
  - Track IP addresses and the volume of requests they send.
  - Log details like request volume, timestamps, IP addresses.
- Store logs in **MongoDB** for attack analysis.

#### 3. **Integrate Blockchain for Immutable Logs**

- Implement **Ethereum/Polygon** integration using **ethers.js**.

### **Phase 3: AI Model Development (Week 6-8)**

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Data Cleaning**: Parse the raw traffic logs from the honeypots into structured data.
- Extract features like:
  - Source IP address frequency.
  - Request intervals (time between requests).
  - Request payload size and types.
- Store preprocessed data in **MongoDB**.

#### 2. **AI Model Selection**

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., **k-means** or **DBSCAN**) to group traffic based on similarity, helping to detect unknown attack types.
- **Supervised Learning**: Train models like **Random Forest** or **SVM** to classify known attack types (e.g., SYN flood, DNS amplification).
- **Botnet Detection**: Use classification techniques to identify botnet traffic patterns (e.g., repeated requests from the same IP in short intervals).

#### 3. **Train Models**

- Train the models using available **public DDoS datasets** (e.g., **CAIDA**).
- Validate models using **cross-validation** techniques.
- Store trained models as files or in a database for easy loading during inference.

#### 4. **API for AI Prediction**

- Build an **AI inference service** using **Python** and libraries like **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
- Expose an API that can accept traffic logs, process them, and return attack classifications (e.g., "SYN flood detected").
- Integrate the AI service with your **ElysiaJS** backend to call it when analyzing incoming traffic.

  - Create API endpoints to receive raw attack logs from the honeypot services.
  - Store logs in **MongoDB** and trigger AI analysis.
- **AI Analysis Endpoint**:
  - Create an endpoint that receives attack data, sends it to the AI service, and returns the attack classification.
  - Aggregate results for display in the frontend.

#### 2. **Blockchain Logging Endpoint**

- Create an endpoint to store DDoS attack data on the blockchain.
- Implement logic to ensure data is only submitted once to the blockchain to avoid redundancy.
- Ensure that smart contracts correctly store attack data in an immutable way.

#### 3. **Testing and Debugging**

- **Simulate DDoS Attacks**:
  - Use tools like **Hping3** or **LOIC** to simulate DDoS attacks.
